Getting support
===============

Please refer to our documentation before asking questions:

http://django-wiki.readthedocs.io/

**DO NOT USE GITHUB FOR SUPPORT INQUIRIES! USE IRC OR MAILING LIST!**

Django-wiki is community based, please try to be active. If you want help, plan to
give help, too. For instance, if you join IRC, then stay around and help others.

Please use our IRC or mailing list (google group) for getting in touch on development and support. Please do not email developers asking for personal support.
